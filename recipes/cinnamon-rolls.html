            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter <em>(unsalted, softened)</em></li>

            <li>1 cup brown sugar <em>(packed)</em></li>
            <li>3 Tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter <em>(unsalted, softened)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cream Cheese Icing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Tbsp butter <em>(unsalted, softened)</em></li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cream cheese <em>(at room temperature)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk with a teaspoon of sugar in a large bowl. Let sit for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, it will start to froth up.</li>
            <li>To the bowl of your mixer add the sugar, butter, salt, eggs, and flour. Next, pour in the yeast mixture and mix until well incorporated and the dough comes clean from the side of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Place the dough into an oiled bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray or butter. Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface, until it is approximatedly 16 inches long by 12 inches wide. It should be approximately 1/4 inch in thickness. Spread the 1/3 cup of butter evenly over the dough, then sprinkle with the sugar evently over the surface of the dough. Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom of the other edge tightly. It should look like a long log when you are done rolling.</li>
            <li>Cut the roll into 1 1/2 inch slices and place in the prepared baking pan. You can use floss to cut the slices.</li>
            <li>Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size. <em>Altertatively, you can cover and place in the refrigerator overnight.</em></li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350ËšF.</li>
            <li>Place the baking pan in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cooking time can vary greatly!</li>
            <li>While the rolls are baking make the icing by mixing all the icing ingredients and beat well with an electric mixer until fluffy and smooth.</li>
            <li>When the rolls are done, spread generously with icing.</li>
        </ol>
