# Odin Project - Recipes

See the deployed site here: [Odin Project - Recipes](https://kelsie-c.github.io/odin-recipes/)

This project serves to demonstrate the basic HTML skills represented thus far in the Odin project.

Since I already have extensive experience working in the field, I will use this project to go back to basics and make a simple and clean website that also uses CSS skills. I want to follow the curriculum as closely as possible, but I also believe in challenging myself.
